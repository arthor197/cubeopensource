Cube Open Source Projects
==============

forums.thecubeserver.com

Hello everyone! So I've been programming quite a bit lately and I decided to get some people into coding as well as other programmers. Both the projects will be Open source and you don't have to make a commitment you can help wherever you want. However some order will need to be put in place so that we don't end up with a big mess.

We will be using GitHub to upload the code. When you edit code you commit it and then I will view it, Make sure it works properly and then publish it to the cloud.

Here are some information on the 2 projects:

Minecraft:
Language - Java
Goal - To make a fully functional Administrative Plugin.

Gmod:
Language - LUA
Goal - To make a fully functional Team Deathmatch gamemode with a working store.

More Information will be published as we get deeper into the project like, Work in progress, What we need done, etc. For Gmod to edit the code just go into the tdm directory and edit away, For Minecraft go into the src folder and then edit away!

The final MC product will be published on bukkit as an open source Plugin. For Gmod the Team deathmatch gamemode will be uploaded to the workshop (Open source.)
